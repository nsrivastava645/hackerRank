Solution:
static int countingValleys(int n, String s) {
        int pos = 0;
        int valleyCount = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<n;i++){
            if(s.charAt(i)=='U'){
                if(pos==-1){
                    valleyCount++;
                }
                pos++;
            }else{
                pos--;
            }
           

        }
        return valleyCount;

    }
    
    Approach:
    Basically, whenever you go down to -1 you enter a valley, and if another -1 is reached you have been at sea level which means
    you cleared one valley, so increase the valleyCount whenever you reach below sea level.
